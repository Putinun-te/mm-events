## Current Status

**Backend startup time**: ~5-10 minutes from instance launch

### Timeline

```bash
$ curl https://t55pviree7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/auth/test
"Auth API is working!"
```

### Login endpoint works:
```bash
$ curl -X POST https://t55pviree7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"usernameOrEmail":"abc","password":"12345678"}'
{"token":"eyJhbGc...","username":"abc","email":"abc@example.com"}
```

### Frontend login works:
